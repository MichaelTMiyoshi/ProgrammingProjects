# Programming Projects

You might have noticed that the programming projects links from the landing website all take you to this same spot.  This is because the introductory students and the AP Computer Science (APCS) students have choices on their projects and can choose to do many of the same projects.  This does not mean that APCS students should just redo their introductory projects using java.  I would suggest not doing that.  What it means is that students have a wide array of options to choose from.  And if there is something you would like to do that is not on the list of projects, talk to me about it.  I may or may not allow it, and it may or may not make the list for current and/or future students.

All of the projects require using variables and/or constants, Input/Output (I/O), branching, and looping.  A column of skills gives you an idea of other skills that are probably needed to do the project.  (If looping is listed, then the previously mentioned skills should suffice to do the program.)  Skills listed in parentheses are probably needed although you might be able to get by without them.  And just because a skill (like using functions) is not listed, does not mean that you cannot use that skill or technique.

### The Rubric

[See the rubric](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/ProgrammingProjects/blob/main/Rubric-ProgrammingProjects.md)

The [Excel file rubric](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/ProgrammingProjects/blob/main/Rubric-ProgrammingProject.xlsx) can be downloaded and used as a self-evaluation tool.  It is more detailed than the rubric page.  You may download it and use it as a self-check and self-evaluation of your project.  Fill it out, print it, staple it to the front of your printed code, and turn it in.

The Game and App Development class uses a different evaluation tool.  (It and some example write-ups can be [found here](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi/tree/main/_CommonDocuments).)

Legend:

X means that you can do this program in this particular class.  No X does not mean that you cannot do it, but you will probably have more problems than you can handle.  Mostly because of the Java interface.  I know that this might prove to be a challenge to some people.

NX means that the project can be used for N projects.  In other words, if you are required to do four projects and you decide to do a project with a 2X, you only need to do three projects total (unless you do another 2X project).

R means required.  More than just Levenshtein may be required in the future.

The semester is a suggestion for introductory students.  Not that introductory students cannot do second semester suggested projects, they will just need to learn more than the first semester content to do so.

Notes:

This list of projects is not comprehensive.  It is a list of ideas.  You can come up with your own projects, within reason.  There are specific competencies or skills that you need to develop when learning to program.  If you a project you suggest does not help you develop those skills, you will probably not be allowed to do it.  At least not without some modifications.  And if you come up with a good project that ought to be added to the list, I will do so.  There are many good projects out there that are not listed here.

There are several projects (like Levenshtein) that would require introductory students to learn topics beyond their required course of study, like recursion.  This does not mean that students cannot do the project.
