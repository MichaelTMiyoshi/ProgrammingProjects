# ProgrammingProjects

You might have noticed that the programming projects links from the landing website all take you to this same spot.  This is because the introductory students and the AP Computer Science (APCS) students have choices on their projects and can choose to do many of the same projects.  This does not mean that APCS students should just redo their introductory projects using java.  I would suggest not doing that.  What it means is that students have a wide array of options to choose from.  And if there is something you would like to do that is not on the list of projects, talk to me about it.  I may or may not allow it, and it may or may not make the list for current and/or future students.

| Snake | Eat the characters while growing longer | X |  | X |
