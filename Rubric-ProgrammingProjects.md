| Project does what it is supposed to do | 75.0% | 3.0 |
| Project has required elements (see below) | 87.5% | 3.5 |
| Project has enough comments and/or github commit message are clear and insightful | 92.5% | 3.7 |
| Project has elegant code and/or unique algorithm and/or unique implementation | up to 100.0% | 4.0 |

## Required Elements

### Intro Students

For the beginning students, Semester 1 Projects 1-3 must be projects that demonstrate the use of variables and constants, Input/Output (I/O), branching, and looping.  Semester 1 Projects 4 and 5 must contain these elements, and must also use enum, functions, and classes to be eligible for full points.  There will be four projects for semester 2.  The first two projects will use lists and files (students may choose to do one project using each or they may both contain both elements).  The third and fourth projects are graphical games.  Project 3 is completing the Williams Game Engine Tutorial [see repo](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/WilliamsGameEngine.CSharp).  Project 4 is a graphical game using either the Williams Game Engine or Unity.

### AP Computer Science Students

AP Computer Science students have similar project requirements.  They should use more advanced techniques in each project finishing first semester with at least advanced data structures like Lists, Maps, Sets, and the like.  They are required to at least do the Mastermind scoring function first semester.  Second semester, they may do the recursion goal sheet as a project.  They must do Levenshtein, plus a third project.  Their fourth project must be released to the wild.  At the very least, they must have a project released on a public GitHub repository.
